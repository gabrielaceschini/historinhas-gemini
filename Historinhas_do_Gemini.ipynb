Astrid loved Constitution Day, May 17th! It was a day of flags, parades, and delicious waffles. Every year, she marched proudly in the children's parade, wearing her beautiful bunad, a traditional Norwegian costume.\n> \n> This year, Astrid was especially excited. She had practiced twirling her little Norwegian flag perfectly. But the day before the parade, disaster struck! While playing hide-and-seek with her friends, Astrid tripped and tore a big hole in the skirt of her bunad.\n> \n> Astrid's heart sank. The bunad had been passed down from her grandmother, and it was very special. Tears welled up in her eyes. \"I can't march in the parade now!\" she cried.\n> \n> Her mother hugged her tight. \"Don't worry, Astrid,\" she said. \"We'll figure something out. It won't be easy, but we will try.\"\n> \n> They tried to sew the tear, but the fabric was old and delicate. The stitches kept pulling through. Astrid felt like giving up. \"It's no use, Mama,\" she said sadly. \"I guess I'll just have to watch the parade from the sidelines.\"\n> \n> But Mama smiled. \"Astrid,\" she said, \"Remember what Grandma always said? Norwegians are known for their 'sisu' - their perseverance! We don't give up easily.\"\n> \n> Inspired, Astrid decided to try a different approach. She remembered seeing her grandfather patching fishing nets. Maybe she could patch the bunad too! With Mama's help, Astrid carefully cut a small piece of matching fabric from an old scarf. Slowly and carefully, she began to weave the patch into the torn fabric.\n> \n> It was slow work, and her fingers ached. But Astrid kept going, remembering her grandmother and the spirit of perseverance. Finally, just as the sun began to rise on May 17th, the bunad was mended! The patch wasn't perfect, but it held strong.\n> \n> Astrid beamed with pride. She put on her bunad, grabbed her flag, and ran to join the parade. As she marched through the village, singing Norwegian songs with her friends, she felt a sense of accomplishment she had never felt before. She had faced a challenge, worked hard, and persevered.\n> \n> The parade was wonderful. And Astrid knew, as she ate a delicious waffle afterwards, that this Constitution Day was the best one yet. Not because of the flags or the waffles, but because she had learned that even when things get tough, with a little perseverance, you can overcome anything. And that’s a very Norwegian thing to do. Now close your eyes and remember Astrid, and know that you too can persevere. Good night!\n> \n"},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["--------------------------------------------------------------\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["scenes = scene_descriptor_agent(story)\n","print(\"\\n--- 📝 Agent 3 result ---\\n\")\n","print(scenes)\n","print(\"--------------------------------------------------------------\")"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"B9W2kJiwcwqg","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1747517477132,"user_tz":180,"elapsed":3691,"user":{"displayName":"Gabriela Ceschini","userId":"07703415855744457217"}},"outputId":"ed233c44-9cf5-4267-9e96-bb90034f734f"},"execution_count":19,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["\n","--- 📝 Agent 3 result ---\n","\n","A young girl named Astrid stands in a picturesque Norwegian village, characterized by colorful houses and towering fjords in the background.
